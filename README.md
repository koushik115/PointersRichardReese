# Pointers in C – Practice Programs (Richard Reese)

This repository contains **hands-on C programs focused on pointers**, inspired by and practiced from the book:

> **"Understanding and Using C Pointers" – Richard Reese**

The goal of this repo is to build **deep, practical intuition** about pointers as used in **systems programming, embedded software, and low-level C development**.

## 📌 What this Repository Covers

The programs explained and implemented here focus on:

* Pointer arithmetic and memory layout
* Relationship between arrays and pointers
* Multidimensional arrays using pointers
* Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()` / `realloc()` / `free()`
* One-dimensional, two-dimensional, and higher-dimensional dynamic arrays
* Proper memory deallocation patterns
* Flattened (contiguous) vs non
